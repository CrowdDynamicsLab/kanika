\section{Result Analysis}
\label{sec:trajectory}
In this section, we perform analysis of archetypes identified by our model. We first describe the discovered archetypes of all researchers in~\Cref{sec:acad}. Then, we examine gender variation in academic trajectory in~\Cref{sec:discussion} and effect of archetype and gender on grant income in~\Cref{sec:grant}. Finally, we describe discovered archetypes for the largest Stack Exchange community, StackOverflow in~\Cref{sec:stack}.

\subsection{Discovered Archetypes of Academics}
\label{sec:acad}
Our analysis reveals four dominant archetypes: \emph{Steady}, \emph{Diverse}, \emph{Evolving} and \emph{Diffuse}. We chose the number of clusters $C=4$ using the elbow method \cite{elbow:2001}: data log-likelihoods increased rapidly till four clusters with much slower increase beyond that. Further, we chose the number of states per cluster, $K=5$: beyond five states, KL divergence\cite{kl:1951} between mean vectors of new states with previous states started reducing rapidly, indicating redundant states.

We also conducted t-test to validate differences among the identified archetypes. Specifically, paired-sample t-test \cite{goulden:1949} is conducted between likelihood values of data points assigned to an archetype with their likelihood values obtained from rest of the archetypes. For instance, for each archetype pair $(p, q)$, we conduct paired t-test between $\log P(X_i| \lambda^p)$ and $\log P(X_i| \lambda^q)$ $\forall i \ni c_i=p$. Note that test results for archetype pair $(p, q)$ are not symmetric.
We observed that all archetype pairs are significantly different ($p < .001$) from each other. Now, we proceed to discuss what is common to these discovered archetypes before examining each one in detail.

	\label{fig:acadclusters} Trajectory (state sequence) for \emph{Steady} archetype in the Academic Dataset. Each pie is a \emph{latent state} or \emph{behavioral stage} in the trajectory. It denotes the mean proportion of papers published in each \emph{Area of Interest}'s in the latent state. Each state is also labeled with the average amount of time spent in the state. For example, in this cluster, 87\% of publications in the first 3.5 years are in the author's primary \texttt{AoI} $D_1$ while rest 11\% are in exploring other areas. The arrows on the top of each pie show the prior probability for starting in that state. As we learn a left-to-right G-HMM, an author can transition to its immediate next state or any later latent states. Each transition is labeled with the corresponding conditional transition probability i.e., transition probability given that the user has decided to transition. The arrows thickness is proportional to its weight. Authors in this cluster exhibit \emph{steady} research interest in their primary \texttt{AoI} $D_1$. Some authors start contributing dominantly in their secondary \texttt{AoI}, $D_2$ in State 4. Though, they return to spending around half of their effort in $D_1$ in State 5.

\end{table}

\texttt{Commonalities in Archetypes:} Table \ref{tab:mean} summarizes the trajectories (state sequences) learned for the four different archetypes in this dataset. Each archetype is labeled according to our interpretation of the user behavior, looking at the learned mean vector of G-HMM states. We observe that all archetypes exhibit similarities, especially in the first two stages. Across all archetypes, the first \emph{stage} typically spans around $3$ years, and more than 72\% of the published research is in the author's \emph{primary} \texttt{AoI}: $D_1$. As noted before, this is most likely their Ph.D. dissertation area, and hence, the research is more focused. After gaining some research experience, most authors move to the second \emph{stage} where they start exploring other research areas denoted by a marked increase in their \emph{Explore} \texttt{AoI}(more than 74\%). However, in state 3 and beyond, authors from different archetypes follow different trajectories where they differ in how they change their dominant \texttt{AoI} over time while \emph{exploring} other domains \footnote{We observe that all archetypes have similar number of authors (\cref{tab:acadclusterdata}) and similar average number of active publication years.}. Below, we describe each archetype in more detail.

\texttt{Steady}: The first major archetype is of \emph{steady} researchers, who mainly work in \emph{one} \texttt{AoI} (i.e. their $D_1$) throughout their career. Fig \ref{fig:academic} shows the state sequence of this archetype. We can see that most people start in their primary \texttt{AoI}, $D_1$ (state 1), which possibly reflects their Ph.D. education. After graduation, they spend some time \emph{exploring} other areas while continuing to publish in $D_1$ (state 2), but move back to publishing in $D_1$ for a significant portion of their careers, about 7.5 years (state 3). This shift is often again followed by a phase where they start working in another area, $D_2$, while continuing to publish in $D_1$ (state 4). They eventually revert to publishing in $D_1$ (state 5) towards the latter part of their careers. In the last state, they also publish widely in other areas (indicated by almost half of the pie divided between other $D_m$'s), but their main interest remains $D_1$.

For example, Michael Jordan, professor at the University of California, Berkeley exhibits this research trajectory. He is a Machine Learning expert; his primary \texttt{AoI} $D_1$, and has secondary interests in Data Mining, Optimization, and Bioinformatics.
Theory professor at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), Jeff Erickson is also assigned to this cluster; he also publishes in his primary \texttt{AoI} $D_1$ (Theory) with auxiliary interests in mathematical optimization.

\texttt{Diverse}: The second archetype consists of researchers with \emph{diverse} research interests as they make significant contributions in multiple $D_m$'s. Similar to \emph{steady} researchers, these researchers research in their primary \texttt{AoI} $D_1$ while \emph{exploring} other domains in the initial $3$ states as shown in Table \ref{tab:mean}. They, then, publish in $D_2$ and $D_1$ while spending half time \emph{exploring} other possible interests (state 4). They evolve to have a strong research presence in all $5$ AoIs (state 5). This behavior suggests that authors of this archetype tend to work in interdisciplinary areas; or possibly projects with a broader scope which gains acceptance by different research communities.
One notable example is Prof. Jiawei Han at UIUC, who started his academic career studying Databases and Data Mining, is also making notable contributions in Machine Learning and Bioinformatics lately.
Another professor who started in Databases, Jaideep Srivastava of the University of Maryland, evolved on to research distributed implementation of databases, and also data mining and AI-related research simultaneously.

\texttt{Evolving}: These researchers have one dominant area of interest (\texttt{AoI}) in each state which \emph{changes} with time. Their dominant  area of interest (\texttt{AoI}) \emph{evolves} from $D_1$ (72\%) in state 1 to $D_2$ (66\%) in state 4 to $D_3$(43\%) in state 5. Even though their \texttt{AoI} shifts across stages, in any given stage, they remain focused on one area and do not publish much in other areas.
James Foley, a professor in Georgia Tech, started in Computer Graphics and later switched to research on user-computer interfaces and recently, User Modeling.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) expert Daniel Jurafsky at Stanford University, also steadily moved from pure NLP based research problems to Speech processing, and later to Machine Learning (ML). Also note, for Jurafsky, this evolution can be attributed to the broader field shift of using sophisticated ML models to solve NLP problems.

\texttt{Diffuse}: Authors of this archetype stay focused in one dominant area in each stage; while in the last stage, their research interests are \emph{diffused}. Authors publish considerably in one dominant area in first 3 stages; $D_1$ (state 1, 3) to $D_2$ (state 4). In the last state, which lasts around four years, the authors are infrequently publishing (less than three papers a year) in new subfields accounting for 74\% of their publications. Hence, these authors have \emph{diffused} research interests after they gain experience.
Gerhard Weikum, professor at MPI Germany started in Databases area made a brief transition to Information Retrieval work and later started publishing in Machine Learning and Data Mining fields too. These area evolutions seem to be natural transitions as they are highly interrelated, which explains contributions in all fields.
Anind Dey, professor at Carnegie Mellon University, initially worked on sensor technology and then switched to Web mining and Human Computing related research problems is also another example of this archetype.

	\caption{\label{tab:stackexchangemean} Learned mean vector for each state for four archetypes in the Stack Overflow Dataset. We list the \emph{activities} in sorted order and annotate them with their \% contribution in the state. We list main activities ($>$ 11\%) for each state. Each state is also labeled with it's average number of sessions. The labels reflect our own interpretation of the user behavior.}
\end{table}

We now describe archetypes learned for the Stack Overflow data. Table \ref{tab:stackexchangemean} depicts the latent states for all archetypes. We label the 4 archetypes discovered as \emph{Expert}, \emph{Seekers}, \emph{Enthusiasts} and \emph{Facilitators}. Posting Comments is the most frequent activity in all archetypes as it is a very low cost activity. Moderator actions and Edits are least favored activities by Stack Overflow users. Most of the users spend initial sessions for \emph{posting questions} (state 1) and significant proportion of their later sessions in \emph{posting answers or comments} (state 6).

\texttt{Experts} users join the community to answer queries or post clarifications or edit answers (state 1-6). They spend at least 68\% of their sessions in \emph{posting answers} (state 1 \& 3). They rarely ask questions of their own. In
communities like Stack Overflow, it is vital to have a dedicated group of experts answering queries for it to be sustainable.

\texttt{Information Seekers}
join the community for getting answer to their queries accounting for 69\% of activities per session (state 1). They briefly start contributing by posting answers to the community (state 3) but they end up again in \emph{commenting} (state 6) or \emph{asking questions} (state 5).

\texttt{Enthusiasts} start by asking questions and posting comments (state 1). They, then, start answering questions and commenting on other answers (state 2). They briefly stay (4 sessions) in edit state (state 3) but end up migrating to either commenting again (state 4) or asking questions and commenting (state 5). We denote them as \emph{Enthusiasts} as they use the platform to post questions while simultaneously answering queries from their acquired knowledge.

\texttt{Facilitators} join for information seeking (state 1) but start posting answers, clarifying and editing in state \emph{2-3}. However, later on they take a more subdued approach and only post comments. The reason for this decreased interest is hard to gauge but identifying these users and retaining their interest could be important to sustain the community.


In summary, we identify four dominant archetypes for researchers: steady, diverse, evolving, and diffuse. We observe differences in the evolution of male and female researchers within the same archetype. When we examine the diverse archetype in detail, we observe that women and men differ in where they start, rate of transition, and time spent in mid-career. The differences in grant income are salient across states within an archetype. In general, grant income increases with experience. We also observe differences across genders within a stage of an archetype mostly accompanied by an area switch. Finally, we also identified dominant archetypes for StackOverflow community: experts, information seekers, enthusiasts and facilitators.
