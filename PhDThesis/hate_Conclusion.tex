\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we propose a sentence encoder that extends the graph convolutional network (GCN) to an induced graph built from syntactic dependencies in the text for offensive language detection.
Our model achieved state-of-the-art performance on public hate speech twitter datasets without the use of user features. The overall performance matches or exceeds that of strong baselines such as fine-tuned BERT.
Our framework is interpretable and allows efficient parallel batch processing. Finally, we show that addition of user features is able to gain benefit from strong user homophily in the abusive user accounts that we worked with. This is achieved using a network architecture that allows behavioral priors to propagate from user to user.
