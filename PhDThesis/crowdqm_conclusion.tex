\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
We proposed an unsupervised model to learn a trustworthy comment embedding from all the given comments for each post in a discussion forum. The learned embedding can be further used to rank the comments for that post. We explored Reddit, a novel community discussion forum dataset for this task. Reddit is particularly challenging as posts typically receive a large number of responses from a diverse set of users and each user engages in a wide range of topics.
Our model estimates aspect-level user reliability and semantic representation of each comment simultaneously in a unified optimization framework. Experiments show that modeling aspect-level user reliability improves the prediction performance compared to the non-aspect version of our model. We also show that the estimated user-post reliability can be further used to identify trustworthy users for particular post categories.

Future work includes exploring other validation methods for trustworthiness including manual annotations of the comments. Another direction is to experiment with more sophisticated methods to generate comments' semantic composition, such as recurrent neural networks. Adding learned users and comments representations to a supervised learning framework for improving them further is another interesting future research direction.
